# Phaser Roulette Example

![](http://befiveinfo.github.io/images/shared/roulette-experiment/roulette_thumbnail.png)

This [Phaser JS](https://phaser.io/) script demonstartes a solution to show roulette that rotates and stops at a random position. Needle ticks with animation and sound as the roulette spins.

The script itself could be rewritten into a really simple code and should be able to be integrate into any game at ease. You could use it for a simple game, a small lottery in your game, board games etc.

## Online Demo

Online demo is available at [this website](http://befive.info/phaser_roulette_example/).

## To try this script

1. Make a directory in your web server and copy the content into it.
2. Open http:://yourserver/the_directory_of_your_choice/index.html in your browser
- Note: You can still try the demo by simply double clicking index.html in your computer's desktop. But you will not hear any sound because of CORS issue (please [see here](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/6459-newbie-struggling-with-cors-issues/) for more info).
