# Phaser Roulette Example

![](http://befiveinfo.github.io/images/shared/roulette-experiment/roulette_thumbnail.png)

This [Phaser JS](https://phaser.io/) script demonstartes a solution to show roulette that rotates and stops at a random position. Needle ticks with animation and sound as the roulette spins.

The script itself could be rewritten into a really simple code and should be able to be integrate into any game at ease. You could use it for a simple game, a small lottery in your game, board games etc.

# Application
Games made with a roulette system based on this demo script can be found at:
- [Dealer Ginjirou](http://play.befive.info/dealer-ginjirou/)
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeFiveINFO/BeFiveINFO.github.io/master/images/shared/roulette-experiment/dealer_ginjirou_gamescreen_thumbnail.png)
  - The game uses a single PNG with transparent for the spin wheel discs.
